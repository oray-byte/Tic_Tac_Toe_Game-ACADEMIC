# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game

## Introduction
This was a program that I built in my first CS course at Missouri S&T. This program allows the user to enter the size of the tic-tac-toe board and the number of characters in a row to win. The program features a (dumb) AI who can play with you, but it can only look one move ahead!

## How it works
This section is under construction. I am screenshotting the code and preparing a nice, in-depth explanation of how this program works.
